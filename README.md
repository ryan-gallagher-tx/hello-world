# hello-world
basic hello-world intro repository for learning how github works


My name is a Ryan, and I'm just now exploring the world of computer science. I have a background in geographic information systems database management and aviation.
As I continue down this path, I'm looking forward to being able to come back to this readme to remind myself of how much I've learned, and how far I've come. Especially on the hard/frustrating days.
